    "experience_summary": "Zyn delivers a bifurcated customer experience: exceptional product quality and usage satisfaction paired with significant purchase stage failures due to the 2024 supply crisis. The brand's 77% market share reflects genuine product superiority - FDA-approved, consistent nicotine delivery, premium pouch quality, and smooth flavor profiles that outperform competitors. However, the 80% volume surge in Q1 2024 created nationwide stockouts across New York, New Jersey, and Florida, with retailers implementing purchase limits (10 cans/30 days) that severely damaged purchase accessibility. Digital engagement is paradoxically strong yet uncontrolled - 700 million TikTok views via organic 'Zynfluencer' content that PMI doesn't directly manage, creating brand awareness without formal customer engagement channels. The ZYN Rewards program (15 points/can, up to 900 monthly) drives retention with high-value tech redemptions, but suspended online sales following DC regulatory issues further compound the purchase stage weakness. Competitors aren't capitalizing effectively due to their own limitations, leaving Zyn's dominance intact despite operational failures.",
    "journey_highlights": {
      "communication": "Limited formal marketing per FDA commitment (no mass-market TV/radio), but explosive organic TikTok presence (700M+ views) via 'Zynfluencers' creates strong cultural visibility without direct brand control or messaging consistency",
      "engagement": "Minimal official digital engagement infrastructure - no robust social media community management, customer service touchpoints underdeveloped, relying on organic user-generated content and word-of-mouth rather than brand-initiated interactions",
      "purchase": "Critical failure point - 2024 supply shortage created nationwide stockouts, purchase limits (10 cans/person/30 days), suspended Zyn.com sales, and retail unavailability despite 58.8% unit share; $800M factory investments won't resolve until 2026",
      "usage": "Category-leading product experience - FDA-authorized quality, pharmaceutical-grade nicotine, consistent 20-30 minute pouch life, dry format preferred in US, smooth flavor profiles, minimal drip, discreet mini/slim options",
      "loyalty": "Strong ZYN Rewards program with 15 points per can, redeemable for high-value items (Apple Watch, iPads, Dyson); however, account inactivity expiration (6 months) and suspended online sales create friction points"

    "competitive_gaps": "Zyn's purchase stage catastrophically underperforms relative to its market position - while holding 77% share, availability failures pushed customers toward On! (available 'almost everywhere'), Velo (no reported shortages), and Rogue (widely distributed before Zyn existed). However, competitors failed to fully capitalize: On! lacks Zyn's product quality and flavor complexity; Velo suffers from weaker nicotine delivery and quality control issues (ripped pouches, 'LaCroix of nicotine' flavor criticism); Rogue's 6mg cap limits heavy user appeal. The purchase gap is temporary (Colorado factory online 2026) but represents a missed competitive window where On! could have gained permanent converts with superior retail execution.",
    "strategic_implications": "Zyn's experience excellence paradox - category-best product and loyalty wrapped in category-worst purchase accessibility - demands immediate supply chain prioritization. The $800M factory investments signal awareness, but 18-24 month resolution timeline creates ongoing vulnerability. Strategic imperatives: 1) Restore Zyn.com direct sales to provide purchase alternative during retail shortages; 2) Build owned digital engagement channels to reduce reliance on uncontrolled Zynfluencer content; 3) Leverage ZYN Rewards as customer retention mechanism during supply constraints; 4) Consider regional priority distribution to protect highest-value markets. The brand's product superiority creates loyalty despite purchase friction, but continued supply failures risk permanent defection to improving competitors."

    "rationale": "Zyn's 6.2 experience score reflects a tale of two brands: exceptional usage (8.5) driven by FDA-authorized pharmaceutical-grade quality, consistent nicotine delivery, and category-leading pouch comfort - substantiated by 77% market share and overwhelmingly positive product reviews. The ZYN Rewards program (7.5) outperforms competitors with high-value tech redemptions that create genuine switching costs. However, the 2024 supply crisis devastates purchase stage scoring (4.0): nationwide stockouts, purchase limits, suspended online sales, and opportunistic price increases directly contradicted availability expectations. Engagement (4.5) suffers from absent owned digital infrastructure - the 700M TikTok views are organic/uncontrolled. Communication (6.5) benefits from Zynfluencer cultural penetration but lacks formal messaging consistency. Category average (5.8) reflects a nascent category where no brand delivers complete journey excellence. Zyn leads despite purchase failures because competitors haven't capitalized - On! (6.0) has better availability but weaker product; Velo (5.6) suffers quality control issues; Rogue (5.4) has limited distribution and strength options.",
    "recommendations": "Immediate priority: Restore direct-to-consumer sales capability through Zyn.com to provide purchase alternative during ongoing retail constraints. Medium-term: Build owned digital engagement infrastructure (official social channels, community management, customer service chat) to reduce dependency on uncontrolled Zynfluencer content and capture first-party customer data. Long-term: Leverage ZYN Rewards as crisis management tool - consider bonus points or exclusive access for loyal customers during shortage periods. The brand's product superiority protects market share short-term, but 18+ months of purchase friction risks permanent customer defection as competitors improve product quality and capitalize on Zyn's distribution gaps."
